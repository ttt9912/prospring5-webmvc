-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- @Controller: marks class as Spring MVC Controller

- @RequestMapping(value = "/singer"): this controller handles all URLS
                                      under localhost:9092/singer
 
- @ResponseBody: applied to all methods. Instructs that all return values
                 from the method should be written to the HTTP response
                 directly, and not matched to a view

- @PathVariable: Springs type conversion system automatically converts
                 String to Long

- @RequestBody: automatically binds the content of the HTTP request body into
                the Singer object. Conversion is done by HttpMessageConverter


@RestController (not used here): convenience annotation that combines:
    - @Controller
    - @ResponseBody
    - all methods that are annotated with @RequestMapping are
      automatically annotated with @ResponseBody
